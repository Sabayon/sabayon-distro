Description of how git split ebuilds are managed.

Objective:
ebuilds as similar as possible to git from Portage for easier bumping through
easier merging.

Main idea is:
- special "sab-split" USE flag to control ebuild data (like dependencies) and
  whether the cleanup phase needs to be run,
- cleanup phase that removes unnecessary files and leaves the ones specific to
  a particular split ebuild, executed in src_install,
- the idea is inspired by what (at least some) package managers with native
  support for split packages do.



NOTE ABOUT BUMPING
Avoiding textual conflicts does not mean semantic ones are present so upon
bumping, changes to USE flags and other differences need to be checked.

However, as the cleanup script checks for both additional files (that may be
installed by a newer version) and missing ones (removed), the work of checking
this part upon a version bump is reduced.



DETAILS

About USE flags (set in package.use as usual):
1. All ebuilds should have sab-split USE enabled.
2. Base, shared USE flags should be similar to avoid possible problems with
   different configuration, however this is not checked for simplicity.
3. USE flags that make it different (USE=cvs for git-cvs for example) need to
   be enabled intiutively. REQUIRED_USE is used to check for correctness.
4. Some of the flags (like perl for git-cvs) are not needed per se but are to
   make the builds ("image" directory content) more uniform in terms of
   installed files which is partly required by the cleanup script.
   (In this example, as for git 2.16.2, Perl modules installed by git would
   have been missing, and files installed by git are required to be present by
   the script. More details of this check are below.)

About usage of the cleanup script:
1. All split ebuilds (including git) ignore the fact that some files from other
   split ebuilds (excluding git) files can be missing
   (--ignore-missing-from-class). This is to allow the other ones be compiled with
   less features to speed up building; and less features can mean fewer files in
   the "image" directory. This may be changed in the future if deemed useful.
2. No ebuild ignore missing files files from git itself (there is no
   --ignore-missing-from-class git) as form of a sanity check that in case of any
   USE flag combination, the "core" set of files is always the same. (For
   example, git-cvs installs files specifc to git-cvs and the same set of files
   git does.) This may also be changed.

About the src_install phase:
1. Everything is done as in the git ebuild even though it would be faster to
   install just the needed files. This is a trade off: more computing power versus
   easier and more correct version bumps.



POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS
- Spec files include Perl version in path to modules. After a Perl bump to
  major version, they will need to be updated. (Note that the cleanup script
  does not have support for regexes or wildcard matching. If needed, the spec
  file can be updated e.g. with sed before using.)
- Moving common parts to an eclass.
- Using the same (symlinked) ebuilds for all split variants.
