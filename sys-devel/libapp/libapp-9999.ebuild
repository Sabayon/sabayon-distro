# NOTE: The comments in this file are for instruction and documentation.
# They're not meant to appear with your final, production ebuild.  Please
# remember to remove them before submitting or committing your ebuild.  That
# doesn't mean you can't add your own comments though.

# The 'Header' on the third line should just be left alone.  When your ebuild
# will be committed to cvs, the details on that line will be automatically
# generated to contain the correct data.

# The EAPI variable tells the ebuild format in use.
# Defaults to 0 if not specified.
# It is suggested that you use the latest EAPI approved by the Council.
# The PMS contains specifications for all EAPIs. Eclasses will test for this
# variable if they need to use EAPI > 0 features.

# inherit lists eclasses to inherit functions from. Almost all ebuilds should
# inherit eutils, as a large amount of important functionality has been
# moved there. For example, the epatch call mentioned below wont work
# without the following line:
inherit eutils multilib

inherit git-2
# A well-used example of an eclass function that needs eutils is epatch. If
# your source needs patches applied, it's suggested to put your patch in the
# 'files' directory and use:
#
#   epatch "${FILESDIR}"/patch-name-here
#
# eclasses tend to list descriptions of how to use their functions properly.
# take a look at /usr/portage/eclass/ for more examples.

# Short one-line description of this package.
DESCRIPTION="libapp provides functions to easily perform some often needed operations in application development, such as command line parsing."

# Point to any required sources; these will be automatically downloaded by
# Portage.

# /usr/portage/licenses/.  For complex license combination see the developer
# docs on gentoo.org for details.

# The SLOT variable is used to tell Portage if it's OK to keep multiple
# versions of the same package installed at the same time.  For example,
# if we have a libfoo-1.2.2 and libfoo-1.3.2 (which is not compatible
# with 1.2.2), it would be optimal to instruct Portage to not remove
# libfoo-1.2.2 if we decide to upgrade to libfoo-1.3.2.  To do this,
# we specify SLOT="1.2" in libfoo-1.2.2 and SLOT="1.3" in libfoo-1.3.2.
# emerge clean understands SLOTs, and will keep the most recent version
# of each SLOT and remove everything else.
# Note that normal applications should use SLOT="0" if possible, since
# there should only be exactly one version installed at a time.
# DO NOT USE SLOT=""! This tells Portage to disable SLOTs for this package.
SLOT="0"

# Using KEYWORDS, we can record masking information *inside* an ebuild
# instead of relying on an external package.mask file.  Right now, you should
# set the KEYWORDS variable for every ebuild so that it contains the names of
# all the architectures with which the ebuild works.  All of the official
# architectures can be found in the arch.list file which is in
# /usr/portage/profiles/.  Usually you should just set this to "~x86".  The ~
# in front of the architecture indicates that the package is new and should be
# considered unstable until testing proves its stability.  So, if you've
# confirmed that your ebuild works on x86 and ppc, you'd specify:
# KEYWORDS="~x86 ~ppc"
# Once packages go stable, the ~ prefix is removed.
# For binary packages, use -* and then list the archs the bin package
# exists for.  If the package was for an x86 binary package, then
# KEYWORDS would be set like this: KEYWORDS="-* x86"
# DO NOT USE KEYWORDS="*".  This is deprecated and only for backward
# compatibility reasons.
KEYWORDS="~x86 ~amd64"

# Comprehensive list of any and all USE flags leveraged in the ebuild,
# with the exception of any ARCH specific flags, i.e. "ppc", "sparc",
# "x86" and "alpha".  This is a required variable.  If the ebuild doesn't
# use any USE flags, set to "".
IUSE=""
